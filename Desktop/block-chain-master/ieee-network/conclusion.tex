\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we present a novel architecture for automatically distributed offloading systems in droned-based MEC scenarios.
The architecture brings in the drone as the offloading hub to detect the authorized IoT devices and help them to offload tasks to MEC servers based on the blockchain technology.
The architecture supports the mobility of IoT devices and allow them to join or leave at any time.
To evaluate the system performance, we focus on the offloading latency introduced by the smart contract, and the results demonstrate that the high reliable offloading policy deployed on the smart contract is feasible in specific scalable MEC scenarios.

Our future work focuses on two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Establish a real private blockchain network to evaluate the practical performances, such as the latency and overhead of smart contracts.
\item Design more intelligent offloading policy to apply for more complex scenarios, such as the drones have high mobility to collect the data from IoT devices.
\end{enumerate}
